## Features

- **Real-time AI Detection**: Analyze text instantly with advanced algorithms
- **Multiple AI Model Detection**: Detect text from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GPT-4, and more
- **Detailed Analysis**: Get confidence scores, perplexity metrics, and detailed explanations
- **Predefined Examples**: Test with sample texts from different AI models and human sources
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes for better user experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
