How it works
The user inputs their code in the front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Node.js server takes the input code, creates an input.cpp file, and runs the C++ program. The C++ program generates an output.py file containing the translated Python code. The Node.js server then reads the output of the C++ program (i.e., the translated Python code) and sends it back to the front end for the user to see.
